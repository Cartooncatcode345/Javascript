A lion's coat is typically yellow-gold, and adult males are the only cats to grow a distinctive mane, which can range from blond to black.Males typically weigh between 150–250 kg (330–550 lbs), while females are slightly smaller, weighing 120–182 kg (265–401 lbs). Lions can measure almost 2.5 meters in length."
