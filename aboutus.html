    <img src="./AHHHdrake.jpeg" alt="">

    <p>The brain is the central organ of the nervous system, controlling all bodily functions, interpreting information from the outside world, and giving rise to thought, emotion, memory, and consciousness. It acts as the body's command center, receiving and sending signals via billions of nerve cells called neurons

        The cerebrum is the largest and most developed part of the human brain, responsible for higher functions. It is divided into right and left hemispheres, which communicate through a bundle of nerve fibers called the corpus callosum. The surface is a folded layer of gray matter called the cerebral cortex, which is divided into four lobes: 
Frontal Lobe: Involved in personality, emotions, problem-solving, decision-making, and voluntary movement.
Parietal Lobe: Processes sensory information like touch, pain, and temperature, and helps with spatial awareness.
Temporal Lobe: Essential for hearing, language comprehension, and memory formation and retrieval.
Occipital Lobe: Processes visual information from the eyes, allowing for recognition of shapes and colors. 
2. Cerebellum
Located at the back of the brain beneath the cerebrum, the cerebellum ("little brain") is primarily responsible for coordinating voluntary movements, maintaining posture, and balance. 
3. Brainstem
The brainstem connects the cerebrum and cerebellum to the spinal cord. It controls vital, automatic functions necessary for survival, including: 
Breathing and heart rate.
Sleep and wake cycles.
Digestion and body temperature regulation.
Reflexes like coughing, sneezing, and swallowing. 
How the Brain Works
The brain operates using an intricate network of neurons and supporting glial cells. 
Neurons transmit information through electrochemical signals (action potentials) across specialized junctions called synapses.
Neurotransmitters, which are chemical messengers, are released at synapses to excite or inhibit neighboring cells, allowing for rapid and complex communication throughout the nervous system.
Gray matter, composed mainly of neuron cell bodies, is where information is processed and interpreted.
White matter, made of myelinated axons, acts as the communication wiring, rapidly transmitting signals between different brain regions and the rest of the body. 
The brain's ability to change and adapt throughout life is called neuroplasticity, a key mechanism for learning and memory.
